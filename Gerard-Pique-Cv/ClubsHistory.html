        Piqué made his debut for Manchester United in October 2004 as a center-back, a 67th-minute replacement for John O'Shea in a 3–0 League Cup victory at Crewe Alexandra. He made his Premier League debut on 15 October 2005, again as a substitute for O'Shea, in a 3–1 win over Sunderland.
On 5 May 2007, it was announced that Piqué would be staying at Old Trafford for the following season. Manager Alex Ferguson had intended to assess Piqué's form at La Romareda on 6 May, before a meeting where the two parties would discuss Piqué's future prospects with the club. However, Ferguson was unable to attend because of airline difficulties.
Piqué's return to Old Trafford saw him make nine league appearances during the 2007–08 season. In his first start in the UEFA Champions League, a 4–0 home win against Dynamo Kyiv on 7 November 2007, Piqué scored the first of Manchester United's four goals in that match. In doing so, he became the 450th player to score at least one goal for the club. His second goal for the club also came in the Champions League, in an away match with Roma on 12 December 2007.

        Gerard Piqué played for Real Zaragoza in the 2006-07 season, then on loan from Manchester United. The center-back joined the Aragonese side at the age of 19 and ended up participating in 28 official matches under the orders of Víctor Fernández: he played 22 games in the Primera División league championship, 18 as a starter, where he played a total of 1,565 minutes; and he played another 6 games in the Copa del Rey (five of them from the starting line-up), where he accumulated 474 minutes on the pitch.
Piqué scored two goals for the Aragonese in the domestic league, against Villarreal and Nástic de Tarragona, while he was shown seven yellow cards and one straight red card. The center-back was sent off on the last match day of the championship, against Recreativo de Huelva, in the 62nd minute of the match.
Real Zaragoza qualified for the UEFA Cup that season, finishing the season with 60 points from 38 games. It did so with a balance of 16 wins, 12 draws, and 10 defeats.

        On 27 May 2008, Piqué signed a four-year contract with Barcelona, they paid a £5 million fee for the player.
Piqué's first goal for Barcelona came in the club's 5–2 2008–09 UEFA Champions League group stage win at Sporting CP on 26 November. His first domestic goal for the club followed two months later, on 29 January 2009, in a Copa del Rey match against local rivals Espanyol. The goal, which came from a corner kick in the 57th minute, turned out to be the game winner in a 3–2 victory for Barcelona. On 2 May, Piqué scored Barcelona's sixth goal in a 6–2 El Clásico win against Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabéu.
On 13 May, he picked up the first trophy of his Barcelona career as he helped his club to a 4–1 victory over Athletic Bilbao in the Copa del Rey Final. Three days later, Barcelona clinched the 2008–09 La Liga title. On 27 May, Piqué played against his former club Manchester United in the 2009 Champions League Final, which Barcelona won 2–0 in Rome, completing a historic treble and becoming the first Spanish club to achieve this feat.
On 7 December 2010, Piqué captained his first match for Barcelona, a 5–0 victory against Russian club Rubin Kazan at Camp Nou, in the absence of regular captain Carles Puyol and vice-captain Xavi. On 28 May 2011, Piqué played in his second Champions League Final. Barcelona defeated Manchester United 3–1 at Wembley Stadium to lift the UEFA Champions League for the second time in three seasons.
On 20 May 2014, Piqué signed a contract extension with Barcelona, keeping him at the club until 2019.
Piqué started for Barcelona in the 2015 UEFA Champions League Final on 6 June, as the club won its fifth European Cup/Champions League title by beating Juventus 3–1 at Berlin's Olympiastadion. This made Barcelona the first club in history to win the treble of domestic league, domestic cup, and European Cup twice.
Piqué extended his contract again on 18 January 2018, this time until 2022.
On 3 November 2022, Piqué announced that he would retire following Barcelona's La Liga match against Almería on 5 November. Starting as captain, he was substituted off to a standing ovation in the 84th minute of Barcelona's 2–0 win. The Barcelona players were wearing special shirts for the game with "SEMPR3" printed on the front and Piqué's name and number on the back; "sempre" means "always" in Catalan.
